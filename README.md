# Deploying 2048 Game to AWS Elastic Beanstalk with GitHub Actions ðŸš€

This repository contains the source code and step-by-step tutorial for deploying the popular 2048 Game to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using GitHub Actions. The project aims to simplify the deployment process of web applications and automate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) workflows.

## Overview

In this project, we will learn how to deploy the 2048 Game to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from Amazon Web Services (AWS). Elastic Beanstalk handles the underlying infrastructure, such as EC2 instances and load balancers, allowing developers to focus on writing code and deploying applications with ease.

We'll leverage the power of GitHub Actions, a powerful workflow automation tool integrated with GitHub repositories, to automate the deployment process. GitHub Actions enables us to define custom workflows for building, testing, and deploying applications, making it an ideal choice for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD).
